            Hello! My name is Grace Campbell. I am a senior at Purdue Indianapolis
            majoring in Cybersecurity. Outside of school, I spend time camping, playing 
            video games and exercising. I am excited for this semester and creating webpages.
            Web design was the first coding course I had ever taken, so it is exciting to revisit it!
