            <p>
                When I was creating my final semester schedule,
                I was told I needed another cyber select credit. 
                There were a few options for me, but the one that was 
                most interesting was this course. I remember enjoying
                the web design course freshman year, so I figured it would
                be enjoyable to build on what I had learned at the beginning
                of my college career.
